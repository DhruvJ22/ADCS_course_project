# ADCS_course_project

This repository contains work that I did as part of a graduate level dynamics course at Purdue University. 

I simulated the effect of motor misalignment, jet-damping and mass variation on the attitude of a spinning thrusting CubeSat using analytical solution and numerically integrating the EOMs.
