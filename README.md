# Attitude Dynamics Project

The repository contains work done as part of a graduate level dynamics course at Purdue University.

The attitude dynamics of a spinning-thrusting CubeSat with motor misalignment, jet-damping and mass variation are simullated using eulerâ€™s equation and an analytical solution. The results and analysis are summarized in _CubeSat_Attitude_Simulator_Report.pdf_
